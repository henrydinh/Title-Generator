Five top Game Of Thrones cast members 'to pocket £2million per episode in season seven and eight'

The Friends gang's bumper salaries went down in history when it was reported they were earning $1 million per episode -- but it seems the Game Of Thrones cast have now well and truly overtaken them.

According to reports, the top five cast members from the hit HBO fantasy drama could earn themselves up to £2million per episode. PER EPISODE.

That's a whole £1.2million more than the Friends' £800k average per-episode, although, it should be noted, that was back in 2003.

According to reports, British cast members Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen), Kit Harington (Jon Snow) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) join US co-star Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) and Danish co-star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) in having signed contracts for the seventh and eighth seasons.

It was claimed last November that the big five would be earning £890,000 per episode.

But this new report claims they'll be able to increase their wages to up to £2million per episode thanks to 'complex bonus clauses' enabling them to earn the big bucks thanks to shared percentages of syndication payments from the 170 countries around the world which air Game Of Thrones, according to the Daily Express.

The rumoured pay packets will make the GOT cast the highest-paid actors in television history.

Media analyst Mike Raia told the publication: 'Cable network HBO is breaking the bank to ensure its most successful scripted programme ever goes out with the kind of flourish fans all over the world have come to expect.'

Reps for Game Of Thrones have been contacted for comment.

Game Of Thrones returns to UK screens with season seven on July 17.
